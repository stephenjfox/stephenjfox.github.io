Originally from a [Twitter thread] that helped me put a few thoughts together, concisely.

# Thoughts on Social Progress

After seeking to [hear out a champion of the right][Rubin Trudeau Brownface], I noticed my
  Youtube Recommendations were [leaning][Hoover: darwin's bad math] [rather][Hoover: interview Dilbert] [Right][Rubin: Anti-Democracy].

Because the aforementioned [Twitter thread] would become too long-winded and ephimeral, I
  thought the stream-of-consciousness would be better elaborated on here.

You see, I didn't think this was a batch of Right-leaning media, initially.
  However, I am more cautious - now more than ever - of bodies that call themselves lauded titles such as "University" since I learned about [PragerU's agenda][Prager U: agenda] of [soundbytes][Prager U: soundbytes].
* This is most disappointing because [one of my favorite intellectuals][JBP], who criticizes news
  media for its "60 second answers", has [two][Prager U Peterson: Dangerous Teaching] [videos][Prager U Peterson: Fix Yourself] on the platform. This disappointment was somewhat alleviated in seeing the platform re-cut other footage of
  Peterson [as a smear-campaign against Elizabeth Warren][Prager U: Anti-Elizabeth], rather than letting Peterson speak on
  the matter outright.

So I did a brief Google search, to find that the Hoover Institution auto-completes to "conservative":

![Hoover](/assets/images/2019-09-29/Hoover-Inst-Search.png)


Intrigued, I dug into the site. Actually following the _second_ suggested auto-completion, I found a
  [conservative-friendly op-ed][Stanford Daily: Op-ed Conservative].

What kept me reading was the continual "talking past each other". In one "top comment", there was a call-out of
  ["having missed the point"][Stanford Daily: Conseravite TC].
  * It was amazing to see that what has been occurring in my own life was actually happening at one of the most
    prestige universities in the world, along the exact same lines. It's as if the ideological wars _are indeed_ penetrating our places of learning

Upon reviewing [the cited original articale][Stanford Daily: Statement on Hoover], I got the pronounced feeling
  of "nobody's listening".
  * The argument, briefly:
  
  > Any institution at Stanford must stand with the common goal of pursuing knowledge
    (and truth), regardless of where this pursuit takes us. Hoover's mission statement frames its pursuits with a
    Constitutionalist lens, which is antithetical to the outlined pursuit of knowledge. It is as heinous as saying
    the 18th century was the indisputable "most important" century for all of human history. Also, a Hoover fellow
    requested student debaters do [background research on their debate opponents][Guardian Free Speech Debate Controvery].
    This research - encouraged with somewhat religious dictum - into "grinding down" debate opponents is threatening and plotting against students and cannot be tolerated.
    Given these points, Stanford should consider no longer allowing Hoover to be a part of Stanford

My response:
* Pursue knowledge wholheartedly? Yes. Is the willingness to discard your foundational principles prerequisite
    for that pursuit? For some. For others, then entire point is to stay within _some_ structure (see: Deist scientists). More on this a little later.
* The framing analogy feels strawman-ish. Pursuing intellectual progress with the framing that the U.S. 
    Constitution was a well written document (concession: written by hypocrites) doesn't seem on the same order
    of magnitude as exhalting the 1700's as the best there ever was. A refrain: it's not as harmful and shouldn't
    be condemned as such.
* Doing background research on your opponents as the _human beings they are_ seems like both (1) [good battle tactics][Art of War],
    and (2) a main avenue for empathy. If you intend to persuade someone to your point of view, it tends
    to take patience and an understanding of another's person. If you've done no legwork on this front, you're
    hamstringing yourself to having a more personal interaction. On the other hand, if this was strictly for
    [ad hominem] attacks, the [burden of proof] is on the university professors who signed the [statement against Hoover][Stanford Daily: Statement on Hoover]
* Does this mean that Hoover's permanence at Stanford should be questioned? If not for the [composition fallacy], the answer would be an easy, resounding "__Yes__". Given those darn fallacies, a further investigation or repeat offense(s) will convince me and prevail over my ows potential [logical error][fallacy fallacy]

Stated differently, I think no one is hearing each other because many parties [are convinced of a false binary][black or white] when - in fact - solutions are more subtle than that.

A [top commentor of the original statement][Stanford Daily: SoH TC] tears into the "whatabout-ism" that devolves these discussions. To summarize,

> If one acts outside the code of conduct, in the name of their Institution, should the Actor or the Institution
  (along with the actor) be thrown out?

I lean towards the former, because I like a diversity of opinions, of having my way of thinking challenged, and letting
  people that disagree with me also have room to explore those ideas. My hope in the human spirit - to overcome the shorcomings
  of a given stance - allow me to see past the time in between, where foolish poeples stay ignorant of durations indeterminate.

Here's the thought experiment:

> If everyone at the table thinks something (idea or entity) is bad, is that a settled issue or should we have someone at the
  table that thinks said matter is okay?
  * In the latter case, progress cane be stalled. You can go around and around in circles, rehashing the same, tired arguments,
    never reaching resolution. But _you're inclusive_.
  * In the former case, we stop questioning assumptions. If we didn't question assumptions, there would be ground
    [for a flat earth to stand on][FES]. Questioning assumptions has lead to breakthrough after breakthrough: Richard Feynman, Marie Curie, Ben Carson, or Ian Goodfellow. Breakthroughs change the name of the game of incremental progress.
  
So which is better?
