## Some Space Science that I care about

I am a big fan of [Neil deGrasse Tyson][1], and he is an astrophysicist. As I started 
  [listening to what he's been up to][ndt on rogen, round 3] for the past little while, I got curious:

> What's the difference between an Astrophysicist and an Astronomer? Oh, and I was reminded of Cosmology an hour ago; what's that got to
  do with anything?

After a visit to [the most invasive search engine][gsearch], I found a [relatively-forgotten blog][blog root] that started to cover the
  difference. [Quoting Wikipedia][comparing astros] on the matter, here's the layman's rephrasing that leans on my penchant for Set Theory.

## Definitions

1. ___Cosmology___ is the study of the Universe at large: who, what, when, where, how, and - occasionally - why (metaphysically and physically)
2. ___Astronomy___ is the large field that is a [proper subset] of Cosmology:
   * It concerns itself with the motion of celestial bodies, which is heavily physics-based
   * When there's evidence of some interaction of another science - e.g. "Was something here before our probes landed?" - we start to
    see the _prefixed_ sciences: **astro**biology, **astro**chemistry, etc
3. ___Astrophysics___ is a [proper subset] of Astronomy, dealing strictly with the physical phenoma
   * The line is very blurry with Astronomy-proper, which is more than okay for many of this particular section of the scientific community
   * [History shows][atw] that Astrophysics is often close with engineering disciplines, which may make it more [applied] in nature

That's as far as I can tell.
