오후 4시 22분
Just had a very interesting experience rejecting a donut and being glad to do so.
* Essentially, I experienced a visceral to the intense amount of sugar and the remarkable experience that I didn't receive
  a pleasure response from said introduction of sugar into my system.
* It _felt_ like the donut didn't have any appeal. Like it was this thing that was
  * Didn't taste good
  * Was 400 empty calories
  * Reported made my tech lead feel tired and heavy.

It was really something: reject what you know isn't good for you. Move a little slowly, ask yourself,
  "is this really what I want". Then, just stop.

Try it some time.

Another interesting cognitive moment came to me:
> don't ask a question you already know the answer to

What was I thinking about when this meta-thought came? I was simulating conversations with co-workers regarding replacing my
  cell phones (which are disappointingly crapping out at the same time).
* Those simulations are a topic for another time.


This revelation, though, is complimentary to a friend's advice I once received:

> only ask a question if (a) you already know the answer (b) you are willing to [actually change your mind][LW change your mind]

Basically, it seems to me that you shouldn't talk unless you've thought about something just enough to be
  corrected by a more _knowledgeable_ source
* note, __not__ someone with more "authority" (unless we align knowledge and authority, for philosopher kingdoms)

Or don't say a word, because you never know when it's going to be your last
