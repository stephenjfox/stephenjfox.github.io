## Me

I love fitness, learning, and speaking of intellectual matters. While I am yet to be one
  of the creditted intelligentia, I am well on my way. Stay tuned ;)

I am rather fond of emoji... You have been warned ðŸ˜œ

## This blog

It's a space where I'm going to dump my brain. Sometimes ideas deserve to live outside of
  a notebook, so they might bite someone else; this blog exists to facilitate that brand
  of virality.

Post topics may inculde my Master's essays, programming ideas, random thoughts on music
  and the world at large. I don't get political (I don't fit in the boxes anyway :P).
